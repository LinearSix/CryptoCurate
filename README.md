# CryptoCurate
### A cryptocurrency search and comparison web application

## With CryptoCurate You Can:
* Search for coins based on highest market cap, trade volume, or volatility
* Select coin cards to reveal detailed information about the cryptocurrency
* Compare selected cards side-by-side
* Add and remove coin cards from your comparison until you find the right mix
* Bookmark your results to view later or email/text the URL to another device or a friend.

## Search for Coins:
By default, the screen is populated with the 25 cryptocurrencies with the highest market cap.
Access other coin decks based on highest trade volume or volitility by clicking the green buttons at the top of the screen.
Use the radio buttons to choose the quantity of results to return. (Slower connection speeds may benefit from a smaller quantity request.)

## Choose Your Favorites
Each small coin card returned by your search can be clicked to reveal a large version containing a wealth of pertinent market information.
Choose up to five coin cards to compare side-by-side. Click the gray "X" in the upper right-hand corner of a large card to remove it from your side-by-side comparison.

## Bookmark Your Work
Once you get a set of cards you like, simply bookmark the page for retrieval later.
The large-size compare cards, search criteria, and quantity returned is saved in the URL. 
Keep in mind that the information retrieved is constantly updated, so the same search today will yield a different coin deck tomorrow.
