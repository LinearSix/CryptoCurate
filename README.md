# CryptoCurious
### A cryptocurrency search and comparison web application
The ever accelerating world of cryptocurrency can be daunting to newcomers. 
CryptoCurious allows the user to not only familiarize themselves with the vast array of coins available, 
but to also dig more deeply into the minutia of what technologies and philosophies make each coin unique.
The CryptoCurious web application utilizes three infomation sources and seemlessly combines them to give the user a rich experience.

## With CryptoCurious You Can:
* Search for coins based on highest market cap, trade volume, or volatility
* Select the resulting coin cards to reveal detailed information about the cryptocurrency
* Compare selected cards side-by-side
* Add and remove coin cards from your comparison window until you find the right mix
* Bookmark your results to view later or email/text the URL to another device or a friend

#### We recommend using the Google Chrome browser in full-screen mode for the best experience.

## Search for Coins:
By default, the screen is populated with the 25 cryptocurrencies with the highest market cap.
Access other "coin decks" by clicking the grey buttons at the top of the screen.
Searches can be based on highest market cap, highest 24 hour trade volume, or highest 24 hour volitility.
Use the radio buttons to choose the quantity of results returned. (Slower connection speeds may benefit from a smaller quantity request.)

## Choose Your Favorites
Each thumbnail coin card returned by your search can be clicked to reveal a detailed card for comparison.
This larger card not only provides financial detials, but gives color with relevant qualitative information such as founders and consensus algorithm.
Choose up to five large cards to compare side-by-side. 
Click the gray "X" in the upper right-hand corner of a large card to remove it from your side-by-side comparison.

## Bookmark Your Work
Once you have a set of cards you like, bookmark the page for future retrieval.
You can also copy the URL and send it to another device for viewing on that device's browser.
The large-size compare cards, search criteria, and quantity criteria are all stored in the URL. 
Keep in mind that the information retrieved is constantly updated, so the same search today will yield a different coin deck tomorrow.

### Cryptocurrency is here to stay. We hope CyrptoCurious will welcome new participants into this exciting new market.
