# CryptoCurate
### A cryptocurrency search and comparison web application
The ever accelerating world of cryptocurrency can be daunting to newcomers.
CryptoCurate allows the user to not only familiarize themselves with the vast array of coins available, 
but to also dig more deeply into the minutia of what technologies and philosophies constitute each coin.
The CryptoCurate web application utilizes three infomation sources and seemlessly combines them to give the user the richest experience.

## With CryptoCurate You Can:
* Search for coins based on highest market cap, trade volume, or volatility
* Select the resulting coin cards to reveal detailed information about the cryptocurrency
* Compare selected cards side-by-side
* Add and remove coin cards from your comparison window until you find the right mix
* Bookmark your results to view later or email/text the URL to another device or a friend

## Search for Coins:
By default, the screen is populated with the 25 cryptocurrencies possessing the highest market cap.
You access other "coin decks" by clicking the green buttons at the top of the screen.
Searches can be based on highest market cap, highest trade volume, or highest volitility.
Use the radio buttons to choose the quantity of returned results. (Slower connection speeds may benefit from a smaller quantity request.)

## Choose Your Favorites
Each thumbnail coin card returned by your search can be clicked to reveal a large comparison card.
This larger card contains a wealth of pertinent market information.
Choose up to five large cards to compare side-by-side. 
Click the gray "X" in the upper right-hand corner of a large card to remove it from your side-by-side comparison.

## Bookmark Your Work
Once you get a set of cards you like, simply bookmark the page for retrieval later.
You can also copy the URL and text or email it to another device for viewing on that device's browser.
The large-size compare cards, search criteria, and quantity criteria are all stored in the URL. 
Keep in mind that the information retrieved is constantly updated, so the same search today will yield a different coin deck tomorrow.
